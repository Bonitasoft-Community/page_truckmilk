This Plug in calculated, for a user, all visible tasks, i.e., all tasks visible in the portal, in &Prime;my tasks&Prime;.<br>

Then, one (and only one) email is send to the user, with the list of all tasks.

Plug in required a User Profile as parameters: all users registered in the profile will receive an email if they have active tasks.

The content of email may be defined, using place holder:
<li>Assignedtask list all tasks assigned to the user</li>
<li>	Pendingtasks contains all tasks assigned (except the assigned tasks)</li>
For example, the content may be:<br>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
Your assigned task &lt;br&gt;{{assignedtasks}}&lt;p&gt;Your pending tasks&lt;br&gt;{{pendingtasks}}
</div>

Note: this plugin need the Email JAR file installed. Check tab Maintenance / Information to verify that the JAR is correctly installed.
