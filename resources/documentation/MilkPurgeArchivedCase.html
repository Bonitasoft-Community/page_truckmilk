<h3>Calculated a list of cases to purge</h3>
This option does not purge them, just calculate the list.<br>
 The list is a CSV file, containing the caseid, the process name. A status column is ready to be fulfilled. 
A delay can be set in parameter, and a list of processes.<p>
Example of CSV:<br>
<div class="alert alert alert-info">
caseid;processname;processversion;archiveddate;status
5149;ExpenseNote;1.0;18/10/2019 15:02;
5150; ExpenseNote;1.0;18/10/2019 15:02;
5151;VacationRequest;1.0;18/10/2019 15:02;
</div>

<h3>Purge from List</h3>>

Then, you can delete case from a CSV list. This option works in partnership with the “Purge Archived Case/Get List” Plug-in.<br>
It accepts the same list and check the status of each line. If the status is DELETE, then the case is removed.<p>
Example of CSV to upload:<br>

<div class="alert alert alert-info">
caseid;processname;processversion;archiveddate;status
5149;ExpenseNote;1.0;18/10/2019 15:02;DELETE
5150; ExpenseNote;1.0;18/10/2019 15:02;
5151;VacationRequest;1.0;18/10/2019 15:02;DELETE
</div>
